Exercise: File Upload - Reference Map
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a simple implementation of a file-upload servlet.

URL: http://localhost:8080/Servlet-FileUpload-ReferenceMap-Exercise

Improve the security of this implementation in two ways:

A) Check File Extension
Restrict the upload to the following file extensions: ".png", ".jpg", ".gif"
Reject the upload of other file formats with a response message like:
    "Invalid file type!"

B) Filename to UUID Mapping
Map every file name to a unique UUID string and store the relation filename->UUID
into a Map. Log the content of this Map with every file upload - use LOG.info().
(In a real project we would save this relation in a database table).

Tip: UUID.randomUUID()

Tip: Build and deploy the project using Maven
    $ mvn wildfly:deploy
