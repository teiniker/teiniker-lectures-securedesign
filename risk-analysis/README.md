# Architectural Risk Analysis

At the design and architecture level, a system must be coherent and 
present a **unified security front**. 
Designers, architects, and analysts should clearly document assumptions 
and **identify possible attacks**.
Security analysts **uncover and rank architectural flaws** so that 
mitigation can begin.
