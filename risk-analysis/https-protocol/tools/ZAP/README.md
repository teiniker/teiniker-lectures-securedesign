# OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)

Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is a free, open-source **penetration testing tool** being maintained under the umbrella of 
the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). 
ZAP is designed specifically for testing web applications and is both flexible and extensible.

At its core, ZAP is what is known as a **man-in-the-middle proxy**. 
It stands between the testerâ€™s browser and the web application so that it can intercept and inspect messages sent 
between browser and web application, modify the contents if needed, and then forward those packets on to the 
destination. It can be used as a stand-alone application, and as a daemon process.
