# Knowledge for Software Security

Critical software security knowledge and expertise can be compiled:
* [CWE/SANS Top 25](CWE-TOP25.md)

* [OWASP Top 10 API Security](../../secure-design/web-services/introduction/owasp/OWASP-API-Security-Top10.md)

* [OWASP Top 10](../../secure-design/web-applications/introduction/owasp/OWASP-Top10.md)

These lists are a **tool for education and awareness** to help programmers to prevent 
the kinds of vulnerabilities by identifying and avoiding all-too-common mistakes 
that occur before software is even shipped.
