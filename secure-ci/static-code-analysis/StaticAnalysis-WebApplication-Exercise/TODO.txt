Exercise: Static Code Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a legacy web application.

Use static code analysis techniques (e.g. SpotBugs, Find Security Bugs, Dependency Checker)
to find vulnerabilities in this application.

A) List all security relevant findings together with the corresponding code fragments.

B) Prioritize the findings (what would you fix first) and describe possible
    improvements in the code.

C) Do you also find some more vulnerabilities during a manual code review?
    (list the code fragments and possible improvements)
