# Static Code Analysis 

Static code analysis is the process of **extracting information about a program** from its artifacts using 
automatic tools.



## Software Metrics



## Rule-Based Code Analysis
Rule-based analysis tools accept code, build a model that represents the program,
analyze that model in combination with a body of rules.

A static analysis tool **transforms the code into a program model, a set of data structures that represent the code**.

These tools use common language processing techniques:
* Lexical Analysis
* Syntax Analysis (Parsing) 
* Semantic Analysis
Many static analysis techniques were developed by researchers working on compilers and compiler optimization problems.
