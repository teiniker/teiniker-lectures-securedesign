Exercise: Static Code Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to find vulnerabilities in this application.

A) List all security relevant findings togethet with the corresponding code fragments.

B) Priorize the findings (what would you fix first) and describe possible
    improvements in the code.

C) Do you also find some more vulnerabilities during a manual code review?
    (list the code fragments and possible improvements)
