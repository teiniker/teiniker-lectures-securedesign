# Introduction to RESTful Services 
In his PhD thesis, **Roy Fielding** identified a set of architectural principles called **REpresentational State Transfer (REST)**.

These architectural principles are defined as:
* Addressable resources
* A uniform, constrained interface
* Representation-oriented
* Communicate statelessly
* **Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS)**

## Addressability
Addressability is the idea that every object and resource in our system is reachable through a unique identifier.

In the REST world, addressability is managed through the use of URIs.

_Example:_ 
```
http://localhost:8080/REST-Service/users/3
```
Using a unique URI to identify each of our services makes each of our resources linkable.

## Uniform, Constrained Interface
REST uses only the finite set of operations of the HTTP application protocol (HTTP methods) where each method has a specific purpose and meaning.

* **GET**: This is a **read-only** operation. It is used to query the server for specific information. 
  It is an **idempotent** (no matter how many times we apply the operation, the result is always the same) and 
  **safe** (invoking a GET does not change the state of the server at all) operation.

* **PUT**: This method requests that the server store the message body sent with 
	the request under the location provided by in the HTTP message. 
	It is also **idempotent**.

* **DELETE**: This method is used to remove resources. It is **idempotent** as well.

* **POST**: This is the only **nonidempotent and unsafe** operation of HTTP. 
	Each POST method is allowed to modify the service in a unique way.

* **HEAD**: This method is exactly like GET except that instead of returning a 
	response body, it returns only a response code and any headers associated 
	with the request.

* **OPTIONS**: This method is used to request information about the communication 
	operations of the resource we are interested in.

There are other HTTP methods (like TRACE and CONNECT), but they are unimportant 
when designing RESTful services.

Advantages of constraining the interfaces:
* **Familiarity**: If we have a URI that points to a service, we know exactly 
	which methods are available on that resource.
* **Interoperability**: HTTP is a very well known protocol. Most programming 
	languages have an HTTP client library available to them.
* **Scalability**: Because REST constrains us to a well-defined set of methods, 
	we have predictable behavior that can have massive performance benefits 
	(e.g. using caches).

## Representation-Oriented

Each service is addressable through a specific URI and representations are exchanged 
between the client and service.

These representations could be **XML**, **JSON**, **YAML**, or any format we can 
come up with.

The representation is the message body of a HTTP request or response. 
HTTP uses the **Content-Type header** to tell the client or server what data format 
it is receiving. With the **Accept header**, a client can list its preferred response 
formats.

## Communicate Statelessly

Stateless means that there is no client session data stored on the server. 
The server only records and manages the state of the resources it exposes.

If there is a need for session-specific data, it should be held and maintained 
by the client and transferred to the server with each request as needed.

A service that does not have to maintain client sessions is a lot easier 
to scale, without expensive replications in a clustered environment.


## HATEOAS

Hypermedia is a document-centric approach with the added support for embedding 
links to other services. Hyperlinks allow us to reference and aggregate 
additional data without bloating our responses.

In **Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State**, with each request returned 
from a server it tells us what new interaction we can do next, as well as where 
to go to transition the state of our applications. 

## Roadmap to REST

This roadmap provides a good step by step way to understand the basic ideas 
behind restful thinking:

* Level 1: tackles the question of handling complexity by using divide and conquer, 
	breaking a large service endpoint down into multiple resources.

* Level 2: introduces a standard set of verbs so that we handle similar situations 
	in the same way, removing unnecessary variation.

* Level 3: introduces discoverability, providing a way of making a protocol more 
	self-documenting.
