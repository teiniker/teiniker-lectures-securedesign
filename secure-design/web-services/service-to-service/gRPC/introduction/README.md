# Microservices using gRPC

**gRPC** is a high performance, open source RPC framework initially developed by Google.
The framework is based on a **client-server model** of remote procedure calls.
A client application can directly call methods on a server application as if it was a local object.


## Introduction
In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as 
if it were a local object, making it easier for us to create distributed applications and services. 

As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of **defining a service**, specifying the methods that 
can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. 

On the **server side**, the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls. 
On the **client side**, the client has a stub (referred to as just a client in some languages) that provides 
the same methods as the server.

gRPC clients and servers can run and talk to each other in a **variety of environments**.
For example, you can easily create a gRPC server in Java with clients Python or Ruby.
