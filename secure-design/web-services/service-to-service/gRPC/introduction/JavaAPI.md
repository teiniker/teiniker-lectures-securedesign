# Java gRPC  API 

Starting from a service definition in a .proto file, gRPC provides protocol buffer compiler plugins that generate
client- and server-side code.
gRPC users typically call these APIs on the client side and implement the corresponding API on the server side.

* On the **server side**, the server implements the methods declared by the service and runs a gRPC server
  to handle client calls. The gRPC infrastructure decodes incoming requests, executes service methods,
  and encodes service responses.

* On the **client side**, the client has a local object known as stub (for some languages, the preferred term
  is client) that implements the same methods as the service.
  The client can then just call those methods on the local object, wrapping the parameters for the call in the
  appropriate protocol buffer message type - gRPC looks after sending the request(s) to the server and
  returning the serverâ€™s protocol buffer response(s).
