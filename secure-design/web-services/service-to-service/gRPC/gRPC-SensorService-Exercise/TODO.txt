Exercise: gRPC Service - SensorService
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a "SensorService.proto" file, implement the missing server-side and client-
side code to make the given tests in "GRPCClientTest" work.

A) GRPCServer
    Implement a "GRPCServer" class which set up the gRPC service (port 8080)
    using the "SensorServiceImpl" class you have implemented before.

B) SensorService
    Implement a "SensorServiceImpl" class that includes the measure method which
    returns the following data depending on the passed sensor.getType():
        DHT11: => DHT11, 23.7, "Â°C"
        DHT22: => DHT22, 61.2, "%"
        HC_SR04: => HC_SR04, 24.5, "cm"
    Tip: Review the given test cases in "GRPCClientTest".

C) GRPCClientTest
    Implement the missing "setUp()" and "tearDown()" methods to establish a
    working connection to the "SensorService"

D) mTLS
    Improve the communication security between the "GRPCServer" and the "GRPCClient"
    by creating a mutual TLS connection.
