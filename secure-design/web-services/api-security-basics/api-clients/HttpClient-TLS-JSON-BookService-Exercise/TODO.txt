Exercise: HttpClient + TLS + JSON Mapping (BookService)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement test cases for the given BookService, including TLS connection and
JSON mapping.

Setup:

$ cd api-tls/SpringBoot-BookService-TLS 
$ mvn spring-boot:run 

$ curl -ik https://localhost:8443/books

A) Data Transfer Object (DTO)
    Implement a DTO named "Book" containing the following properties:
    - id:long
    - author:String
    - title:String 
    - isbn:String 

B) Replace the following curl statements by test cases, implemented
    in a class named "HttpRequestsTest":
    testFindAll():  curl -ik https://localhost:8443/books
    testFindById(): curl -ik https://localhost:8443/books/2
    testFindByInvalidId(): curl -ik https://localhost:8443/books/666
    testInsert():   curl -ik -X POST https://localhost:8443/books -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"author":"Robert C. Martin","title":"Clean Code","isbn":"978-0132350884"}'
    testUpdate():   curl -ik -X PUT https://localhost:8443/books/1 -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"author":"Joshua Bloch","title":"Effective Java, 2nd Edition","isbn":"978-0134685991"}'
    testDelete():   curl -ik -X DELETE https://localhost:8443/books/2

    Note that after DELETE you have to restart the service because
    the database has been modified.

    Tip: Use a base class named "HttpRequestsBase" to implement common 
    methods for test cases.
