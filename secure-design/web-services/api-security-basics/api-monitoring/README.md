# API Monitoring in Spring Boot

API monitoring involves **tracking and observing the performance, availability, 
and behavior of APIs** to ensure they operate as expected. 

Monitoring helps developers and operators identify issues like high latency, 
errors, or bottlenecks and proactively address them before they impact end-users.

In the context of Spring Boot, API monitoring typically focuses on:

* **Health checks**: Verifying if the application and its dependencies 
    (e.g., database, message queues) are running.

* **Performance metrics**: Tracking response times, throughput, and system 
    resource usage.

* **Logging and tracing**: Monitoring API requests, responses, and 
    associated logs.

* **Error tracking**: Identifying API failures or exceptions.

* **Operational insights**: Observing system components and configurations.

The **SpringBoot Actuator framework** is a powerful tool for API monitoring 
and management.


## Spring Boot Actuator Framework

Spring Boot Actuator is a module that provides production-ready features 
to monitor and manage SpringBoot applications. 

It exposes endpoints to collect metrics, monitor the state of the application, 
and manage its lifecycle.


Built-in **Monitoring Endpoints**:

* `/actuator/health`: Provides information about the application's health 
    (e.g., status of databases, disk space).

* `/actuator/metrics`: Displays application metrics like memory usage, HTTP 
    request statistics, and thread counts.

* `/actuator/httptrace`: Captures the trace of recent HTTP requests and responses.

* `/actuator/auditevents`: Shows security-related events, such as login attempts.

* `/actuator/loggers`: Exposes and manages application logging levels.

Actuator also integrates seamlessly with metrics libraries like **Micrometer**, 
which supports exporting metrics to monitoring systems like **Prometheus**, 
**Grafana**, or **New Relic**.


## Security Considerations

Spring Boot Actuator endpoints **expose sensitive information** about the application
and its environment.

To secure these endpoints, consider the following best practices:

* **Use HTTPS**: Encrypt communication between the client and server using

* **Enable Security**: Protect Actuator endpoints with authentication and 
    authorization mechanisms.

* **Restrict Access**: Limit access to Actuator endpoints based on roles or 
    IP addresses.

* **Disable Sensitive Endpoints**: Disable or secure sensitive endpoints like 
    `/actuator/env`, `/actuator/configprops`, and `/actuator/beans`.

* **Monitor and Audit**: Monitor Actuator endpoints for unauthorized access

* **Update Dependencies**: Keep Spring Boot and Actuator dependencies up-to-date.
