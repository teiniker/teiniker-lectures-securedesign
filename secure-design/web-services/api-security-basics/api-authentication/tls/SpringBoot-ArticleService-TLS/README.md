# Example: SpringBoot Transport Layer Security 

## Setup TLS

In order to configure a TLS connector, we have to create a server-side certificate and configure the 
application.properties file.

```
$ cd src/main/resources
$ keytool -genkeypair -keystore server.jks -storepass student -keypass student -keyalg RSA -alias server -dname "cn=se,o=lab,c=org"
```

Change `application.properties`:
```
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:server.jks
server.ssl.key-store-type=pkcs12
server.ssl.key-store-password=student
server.ssl.key-password=student
server.ssl.key-alias=server
server.port=8443
```

Now, we can start the service as a separate process:
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
