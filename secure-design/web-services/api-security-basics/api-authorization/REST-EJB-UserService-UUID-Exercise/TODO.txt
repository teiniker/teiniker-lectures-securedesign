Exercise: Replace integer IDs with UUID strings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we use auto generated id values (which is usual a sequence like 1,2,3,...)
an attacker can easily guess id values.

To defend the given Web service against these attacks, you should replace the
given id (which is an integer value generated by the database) with a UUID string.

1. Change src/test/resources/createUserTable.sql  

2. Refactor the classes User and UserDTO		  

3. Refactor UserDAOImpl, UserResourceEJB		  

You can review the class UUIDTest to see how to generate a random UUID!


To test your changes you can use SoapUI:

URL: https://localhost:8443/REST-EJB-UserService-UUID-Exercise/v1/users
                           
1. Insert the following users:

{
   "id": "",
   "username": "homer",
   "password": "ijD8qepbRnIsva0kx0cKRCcYysg="
}

{
   "id": "",
   "username": "marge",
   "password": "xCSuPDv2U6I5jEO1wqvEQ/jPYhY="
}

{
   "id": "",
   "username": "lisa",
   "password": "xO0U4gIN1F7bV7X7ovQN2TlSUF4="
}

2. Request all users to find out their uuid values

3. Request a single user by its id (for example marge)
