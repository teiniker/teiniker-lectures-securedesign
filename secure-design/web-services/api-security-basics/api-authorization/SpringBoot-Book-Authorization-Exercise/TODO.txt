LabExam 2021-10-22: API Basic Security
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a working REST service, which can be started with:
$  mvn spring-boot:run

Using Curl you can test the two resources:
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/books
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/books/1
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/infos

Now, you should add some security measures:

A) Transport Layer Security [2 Points]
Change the service configuration to use HTTPS and test your modifications:
$ curl -i -k https://localhost:8443/books
$ curl -i -k https://localhost:8443/books/2

B) Basic Authentication [3 Points]
Add the Spring Security Module and implement a HTTP Basic authentication
(store username and password in memory, and use BCrypt to encrypt the password)
Again, test your modifications using curl:
$ curl -i -k -u student:student https://localhost:8443/books
$ curl -i -k -u student:student https://localhost:8443/books/1

C) Authorization [3 Points]
The info resource should be accessible for every user, while books should only be
for authenticated users.
Test your modifications:
$ curl -i -k https://localhost:8443/infos
$ curl -i -k https://localhost:8443/books
401 Unauthorized
$ curl -i -k -u student:student https://localhost:8443/books

D) UUID [2 Points]
To be sure that no user can access a wrong book item, change the "long" id
to a UUID string in the service implementation.
Test that feature by loading all books and then requesting one book by its UUID:
$ curl -i -k -u homer:homer https://localhost:8443/books


The small print
---------------
Don't forget to replace MyName with your name, otherwise you get only 50% of
your points.

Tip: Implement the missing parts first and right before you export the project,
    rename it.

Also note that grading is based on a code review, thus, a running test doesn't
automatically mean that you get all points.
