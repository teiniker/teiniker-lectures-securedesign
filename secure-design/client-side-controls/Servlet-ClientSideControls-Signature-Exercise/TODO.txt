Exercise: Client-Side Controls - HMAC Signature Cookie
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a simple web application:

URL: https://localhost:8443/Servlet-ClientSideControls-Signature-Exercise/controller

A) Configure Wildfly to provide a system property
standalone.xml:
	<extensions>
	...
	</extensions>

	<system-properties>
        <property name="hmac.key" value="7cb46d33ae687fa8c98a712cfa7c0f98836405138040a9e03260d03ee8973885e6d800adcccd6dfa2961ea714f2ca3f8a1b1838cc6f86298f93d77368bae8d65"/>
    </system-properties>

We can access these properties from a Servlet using: System.getProperty("hmac.key");


B) Add a signature cookie to the HTTP response
Calculate a HMAC from the DATA value (remember, the DATA value is shipped
as a hidden field within the HTTP response). 

Add this HMAC(DATA) as a cookie with the name "signature" to the HTTP
response.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Set-Cookie: signature=09b925d3d71dcfc15a18b24960f1813ba3576971; secure; HttpOnly
Content-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Length: 1117
Date: Fri, 27 May 2022 14:19:28 GMT

The Browser will store this cookie and send it back with the next request.


C. Check the signature cookie received with the HTTP request
Read the "data" parameter and the "signature" cookie from the HTTP request.
Calculate the HMAC from the received "data" and compare it with the HMAC
of the signature.
If the HMAC values match use the following log line:
	LOG.info("    => hidden field is valid!!!");
otherwise use
	LOG.info("    => hidden field is INVALID!!!");
